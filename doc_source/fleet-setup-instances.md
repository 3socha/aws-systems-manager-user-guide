# Step 2: Verify your instances are managed by Systems Manager<a name="fleet-setup-instances"></a>

For instances to be monitored and managed using Fleet Manager, they must be AWS Systems Manager managed instances\. For information about configuring managed instances, see [Setting up AWS Systems Manager for hybrid environments](systems-manager-managedinstances.md)\.

**Note**  
For servers or virtual machines that are not running on AWS, you must use a hybrid activation to configure the server or VM as a managed instance\. For information about hybrid activations, see [AWS Systems Manager hybrid activations](activations.md)\.
