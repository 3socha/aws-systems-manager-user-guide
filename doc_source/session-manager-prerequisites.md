# Step 1: Complete Session Manager Prerequisites<a name="session-manager-prerequisites"></a>

Before using Session Manager, make sure your environment meets the following requirements\.


**Session Manager Prerequisites**  

| Requirement | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Supported Operating Systems  |  AWS Session Manager supports the following operating system versions:  Session Manager supports Amazon EC2 instances, as well as servers or virtual machines \(VMs\) in your hybrid environment that use the *advanced\-instances* tier\. For more information about advanced instances, see [Using the Advanced\-Instances Tier](systems-manager-managedinstances-advanced.md)\.  **Linux** Session Manager supports all the versions of Linux that are supported for AWS Systems Manager as a whole\. For information, see [Systems Manager Prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\. **Windows** Session Manager supports Windows Server 2008 R2 through Windows Server 2016\.  Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Nano is not supported\.   | 
|  SSM Agent  |  SSM Agent version 2\.3\.68\.0 or later must be installed on the instances you want to connect to through sessions\. To use the option to encrypt session data using a customer master key \(CMK\) created in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\), version 2\.3\.539\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed\.  When a version of SSM Agent that supports Session Manager starts on an instance, it creates a user account with root or administrator privileges called `ssm-user`\. Sessions are launched using the credentials of this user account\. For information about restricting administrative control for this account, see [Step 6: \(Optional\) Disable or Enable ssm\-user Account Administrative Permissions](session-manager-getting-started-ssm-user-permissions.md)\.  To install or update SSM Agent, see [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent](ssm-agent.md)\.  | 
|  AWS CLI  |  \(Optional\) If you use the AWS CLI to start your sessions \(instead of using the AWS Systems Manager console\), version 1\.16\.12 or later of the CLI must be installed on your local machine\. You can call aws \-\-version to check the version\. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\.SSM Agent is updated whenever changes are made to Systems Manager and when new capabilities are added\. To ensure that your instances are always running the newest version of SSM Agent, we recommend that you update the agent automatically whenever a new version is available using either of the following methods\.  Use a State Manager association\. For information, see the State Manager topic [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)\. Use a Maintenance Window\. For information, see the Maintenance Window topics [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-cli.html) and [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-console.html)\.   You can also use Run Command to manually update one or more instances with the latest version\. For information, see [Update SSM Agent by using Run Command](rc-console.md#rc-console-agentexample)\. In addition, to use the CLI to manage your instances with Session Manager, you must first install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. For information, see [\(Optional\) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.  |
