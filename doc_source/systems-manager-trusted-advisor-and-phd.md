# Trusted Advisor and Personal Health Dashboards hosted by Systems Manager<a name="systems-manager-trusted-advisor-and-phd"></a>

Systems Manager hosts two online tools to help you provision your resources and monitor your account for health events\. Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices\. For more information, see [Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/)\.

The AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides information about AWS Health events that can affect your account\. The information is presented in two ways: a dashboard that shows recent and upcoming events organized by category, and a full event log that shows all events from the past 90 days\.
