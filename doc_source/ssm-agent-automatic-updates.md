# Automate Updates to SSM Agent<a name="ssm-agent-automatic-updates"></a>

An new version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is still running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your instances using either of the following methods\.
+ Use a State Manager association\. For information, see the State Manager topic [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)\.
+ Use a Maintenance Window\. For information, see the Maintenance Window topics [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-cli.html) and [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-console.html)\. 

If you prefer to update SSM Agent on your instances manually, you can subscribe to notifications that AWS publishes when a new version of the agent is released\. For information, see [Subscribe to SSM Agent Notifications](ssm-agent-subscribe-notifications.md)\. For information about using Run Command to manually update one or more instances with the latest version, see [Update SSM Agent by using Run Command](rc-console.md#rc-console-agentexample)\.
