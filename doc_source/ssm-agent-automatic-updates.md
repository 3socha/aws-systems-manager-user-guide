# Automate SSM Agent Updates on Your Instances<a name="ssm-agent-automatic-updates"></a>

SSM Agent is updated whenever changes are made to Systems Manager and when new capabilities are added\. To ensure that your instances are always running the newest version of SSM Agent, we recommend that you update the agent automatically whenever a new version is available using either of the following methods\.
+ Use a State Manager association\. For information, see the State Manager topic [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(CLI\)](sysman-state-cli.md)\.
+ Use a Maintenance Window\. For information, see the Maintenance Window topics [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(AWS CLI\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-cli.html) and [Automatically Update SSM Agent \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/mw-walkthrough-console.html)\. 

If you prefer to update SSM Agent on your instances manually, you can subscribe to notifications that AWS publishes when a new version of the agent is released\. For information, see [Subscribe to SSM Agent Notifications](ssm-agent-subscribe-notifications.md)\. For information about using Run Command to manually update one or more instances with the latest version, see [Update SSM Agent by using Run Command](rc-console.md#rc-console-agentexample)\.
